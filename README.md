# excel vba chart macro

this vba macro automatically generates a clustered bar chart based on data within a specified range in an active excel worksheet. it customizes the chart by setting its size, data range, type, adding a title, legend, and formatting various elements for clarity and visual appeal.

## features

- **automatic chart generation:** creates a clustered bar chart with minimal input.
- **custom formatting:** applies specific formatting to the chart title, axes, and legend.
- **flexible data range:** while preset to a specific range, it can be modified to suit different data sets.
- **no gridlines:** removes clutter by hiding gridlines, focusing attention on the data.

## requirements

- **microsoft excel:** ensure you have a version of excel that supports vba (most versions do).
- **macro settings:** macros must be enabled in excel to run this script.

## setup instructions

1. **open excel:** navigate to the workbook where you want to add the chart.
2. **enable developer tab:** if not already enabled, go to `file` > `options` > `customize ribbon` and check the `developer` checkbox.
3. **open vba editor:** on the developer tab, click on `visual basic`, or press `alt` + `f11`.
4. **insert a module:** in the vba editor, right-click on any of the objects for your workbook listed in the project explorer. select `insert` > `module`.
5. **copy the macro:** paste the provided vba code into the newly created module window.
6. **modify data range (optional):** adjust the `datarng` variable if your data is in a different range than the default `b3:e7`.
7. **run the macro:** press `f5` to run the macro, or close the vba editor and run the macro from the `macros` option under the developer tab.

## usage notes

- the macro adds the chart to the active sheet; ensure the correct sheet is active before running.
- adjust the `chrt.chart.setsourcedata source:=datarng` line to match your data's location.
- the default chart type is a clustered bar chart (`xlbarclustered`). this can be changed to any other excel chart type by modifying the `chrt.chart.charttype` line.

## customization

- chart title, legend, and axes titles can be customized by modifying the respective sections of the vba code.
- for advanced customization (like chart style, color, etc.), additional vba properties and methods can be explored and applied.
